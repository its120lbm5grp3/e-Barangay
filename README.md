# e-Barangay: Secure Document Request System with AI Assistance for Barangay Hall

The eBarangay system acts as a digital service platform for Barangay III Poblacion. By applying 
AI (chatbot) and cybersecurity (2FA, encryption, QR verification), the barangay office will be 
able to:


• Improve efficiency in document processing.

• Strengthen trust between residents and local government through transparency.

• Protect sensitive resident information from fraud and data breaches.

• Provide a modern, scalable solution that makes barangay governance smarter and 
more secure.
